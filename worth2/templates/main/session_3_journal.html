<h3>Problem Solving the POP Way</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        We're going to learn a problem solving technique called
        POP.
        POP stands for:

        <dl>
            <dt>P = PROBLEM</dt>
            <dd>Define the problem and its consequences.</dd>

            <dt>O = OPTIONS</dt>
            <dd>Brainstorm the options (weigh pros/cons).</dd>

            <dt>P = PLAN OF ACTION</dt>
            <dd>
                Come up with a plan to act on best option. Look
                and see how the plan is working and revise plan if
                needed. Reward yourself for any progress you make.
            </dd>

<h3>What is Self Talk?</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        Feelings are deep and often we can't necessarily understand
        easily why things make us feel as they do. This is because
        we just keep accumulating feelings throughout our lives. Even
        as kids we might have an experience that triggers a feeling,
        which can stay with us for life. Sometimes these feelings can
        become triggers for unsafe behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to counter feelings
        that are triggers is to try to change the way you think about
        something. The way to do this is through self-talk. What is
        self-talk? It's your internal voice; the one that you keep a
        running conversation with during the day as you go about your
        business. This internal voice is a constant reflection of how
        you are feeling. It tells you that you will be late if you
        don't leave enough time to get somewhere. It tells you that
        something you said was stupid, if you suddenly feel that you
        said something stupid. Just as the voice tells you negative
        things, you can train it to say positive things.
