<h3>Introduction to the journals</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        This is the first of five "road maps" or "journals"
        you will receive each week. It is yours to keep.
        Many of the items here will contain your private
        and confidential responses to the exercises you
        complete each week, as well as the goals you set.
        Some will also contain additional information you
        learned during the sessions. You can add each road
        map to your E-WORTH folder and keep them at home. Or,
        you can bring them with you to each week. Be sure to
        store the maps that contain more sensitive information
        (that you would prefer to be kept completely private)
        in a safe place.

<h3>Contract of Commitment</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        I agree to participate in Project E-WORTH with my group and
        session facilitator.
    </p>
    <p>
        By agreeing to attend, I am making a commitment to do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Come to sessions on time.</li>
            <li>Attend scheduled sessions.</li>
            <li>Share my experiences.</li>
            <li>Work on goals that I set.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        I will hold in confidence the personal information discussed
        by my fellow group members during sessions. I agree not to
        view personal information on another participant tablet, and I
        also agree not to reveal the identity of anyone in the study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Confidentiality means that everything we discuss in sessions
        is private and is not to be discussed outside of session.
