<h3>Safety Plan</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        This week you created a plan to keep yourself safe
        during a violent incident and a plan in case you need
        to escape a dangerous situation at home. Your safety
        plan follows:
    </p>
    <h4>Safety During a Violent Incident</h4>

    {% for response in safety_plan_quiz_responses %}

        <span class="journal-question">{{ response.question }}</span>
        <strong>{{ response.value }}</strong>
    </p>
    {% endfor %}

    <p>
        In order to leave quickly, I will keep my purse, an emergency
        bag containing cell phone &amp; charger, spare money, money on
        a metro card (or bus/train fare), keys, driver's license or other
        form of ID, copy of restraining order, Birth certificate, social
        security card, immigration papers and other important documents,
        change of clothing, medications, special photos or other valuable
        items. If I have children&ndash; anything they may need (important
        papers, medication, formula, diapers, etc&hellip;)
    </p>
    <p>
        I can tell a person that I trust about the violence and request
        they call the police if they hear suspicious noises coming from
        my apartment. One person I can tell is:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-part-4/).
        Another person I can tell is: (/pages/session-4/safety-5/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will also keep a list of other individuals I can call in the
        event of an emergency. I will keep a hard copy of this list as
        well as have their names in my phone. These individuals do not
        live close to me but I can trust them to call the police or
        assist in other ways if I call them directly or have someone
        else (i.e. my children) call.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can teach my children (or someone else I trust in my household)
        how to use the telephone and dial 911 to contact the police and
        the fire department.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can use a code word with my children or my friends so they can
        call for help. (CODE WORDS should not raise suspicion from
        partner, but should not also be "every day" language that might
        confuse people. Some examples of code words are "Aunt has not
        returned my phone call today". Code words for children need to be
        appropriate for their age. For example, a code word for a 13 year
        old girl may be "Your cousin called you today and wants you to call
        her back today". For a younger child "Your grandmother called
        today and wanted to talk with you about something."
        (Most children under the age of 5 will be too young to understand
        how to operate under code language, you will need to figure out
        who you can trust with this task). My code word will be:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-part-8/)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's a good idea to decide where you can go if you have to leave
        your apartment. Decide this even if you don't think you will
        experience another violent incident.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I have to leave my home I will go to: (answer to question 1 from
        here: /pages/session-4/safety-part-9/). If I cannot go to the
        location above I will go: (answer to question 2 from here:
        /pages/session-4/safety-part-9/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I can also teach these strategies to some or all of my children (or
        someone else I trust in my household).
    </p>
    <p>
        Try to avoid arguments in the bathroom, and kitchens, near weapons
        or in rooms without access to an outside door.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I expect we are going to have an argument, I will try to move
        to a space that is lowest risk, such as:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-part-11/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will use my judgment and intuition. If the situation is very
        serious, I can give my partner what s/he wants to calm him/her
        down. I have to protect myself until I/we are out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will also use my judgment and intuition in instances in which
        my partner is under the influence of drugs or alcohol and I am
        worried that s/he may hurt me sexually and/or physically. In these
        instances, in addition to giving my partner what s/he wants to
        calm him/her down, I will try to leave the situation until my
        partner calms down.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I plan on drinking or using drugs, I will take extreme
        precaution to avoid being in an unsafe physical and/or
        sexual situations. I will also try to have a sober driver
        who is not my partner.

        Safety when leaving:
    </p>
    <p>
        I can use some or all of the following safety strategies:
    </p>
    <p>
        So that I can leave quickly, I will leave money and an extra
        set of keys with: (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-1/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will keep copies of important documents (social security
        cards, birth certificates, immunization records) or keys
        at: (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-2-256/)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to become financially independent. To get help
        with becoming financially independent from your partner call
        1-800-873-2227.
    </p>
    <p>
        To increase my independence, I will open a savings account
        by (date): (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-3/)
    </p>
    <p>
        Other things I can do to increase my independence include:
        /pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-1-254/
    </p>
    <p>
        Call 311 and ask for the NYC Domestic Violence Hotline
        (1-800-621-4673 or 1-866-604-5350) if you need counseling,
        legal assistance or emergency housing. If you are feeling
        threatened by your partner or in more immediate danger, call
        911 for the police.
    </p>
    <p>
        Explore the possibility of obtaining a restraining order by calling
        311 or the NYC Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-621-4673 or
        1-866-604-5350) so that you'll have legal support in keeping your
        partner away.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep a calling card on you at all times. If you use your cell
        phone, the following month the telephone bill will tell your
        partner those numbers that you called after you left. To keep
        your calls confidential, you must use a calling card for a
        limited time when you first leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Google+,
        Twitter, Linked In, etc.) and are either "friends" with your partner
        or "friends" with anyone in your partner's social media network, it
        is important to block your partner and/or his/her friends so they
        cannot access you via these avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will check block my partner and/or his/her friends from the
        following social media accounts:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-8/)
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to find people who will let you stay with them or
        lend you some money.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will check with the following people to see if I can stay with
        them or borrow money: (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-9/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I can leave extra clothes and other emergency items (i.e. money,
        telephone contact list, etc…) with:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-10/)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to review your safety plan occasionally. How often
        will you sit down and review your safety plan?
        (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-11/)
    </p>
    <p>
        Ask a trusted friend or advocate to help you review your plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        The person I will ask is:
        (/pages/session-4/safety-when-leaving-part-12/)
    </p>
    <p>
        I will rehearse my escape plan and, as appropriate, practice it
        with my children.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will see if my phone company can block my abuser’s phone number
        from calling my phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will change my usernames, email addresses, passwords,
        and/or cell phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will save and keep track of any abusive, threatening or
        harassing comments, posts, or texts.
