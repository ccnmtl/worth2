<h3>Safety Plan</h3>
<div class="worth-journal-info-element">
    <p>
        If you or a family member or friend is experiencing
        relationship conflict or abuse by a partner, there are steps
        you can take to reduce conflict and to help prevent being hurt
        by a partner. Having a safety plan can reduce your risk for
        being hurt by your partner. Today you created this safety
        plan:

    <h4>Safety During a Violent Incident</h4>

            I will practice how to get out of my apartment safely
            and practice this plan with my children. Here is how I
            will safely leave my apartment if I need to:
            <strong>{{ response.value }}</strong>
        </p>
        {% elif forloop.counter == 2 %}
        <p class="journal-question">
            I can tell a person whom I trust about the violence and
            request they call the police if they hear suspicious
            noises coming from my house or apartment. Here are some
            people I can tell.
            <strong>{{ response.value }}</strong>
        </p>
        {% elif forloop.counter == 3 %}
        <p class="journal-question">
            I can keep a list of other people I can call if there is
            an emergency. I can keep a paper copy of this list and
            keep the names in my phone. The people on the list don't
            need to live close to me. These are people I can trust to
            call the police or help in other ways if I contact them
            or have someone else contact them. I can also teach my
            children or someone else in the house how to use the
            telephone and dial 911 to contact the police and the fire
            department.
        </p>
        <p class="journal-question">
            I can use a code word with children or friends to call for
            help. CODE WORDS should not raise suspicion from partner,
            but should not also be "every day" language that might confuse
            people. Some examples of code words are "Aunt ____ has not
            returned my phone call today". Code words for children need
            to be appropriate for their age. For example, a code word
            for a 13 year old girl may be "Your cousin ____ called you
            today and wants you to call her back today". For a younger
            child "Your grandmother called today and wanted to talk with
            you about something." (Most children under the age of 5 will
            be too young to understand how to operate under code
            language). My code word will be:
            <strong>{{ response.value }}</strong>

        {% elif forloop.counter == 4 %}
        <p class="journal-question">
            I need to have a place to go if I have to leave my apartment.

            When I expect I am going to have an argument with my partner,
            I will move to a space that is lowest risk. I will try to
            avoid arguments in the bathroom, kitchens, near weapons, or
            in rooms without access to an outside door. Here are spaces
            in my apartment that are the lowest risk:

        <p class="journal-question">
            I will use my judgment and intuition. If the situation is
            very serious, I may need to give my partner what he or she
            wants to calm him or her down. I will protect myself until
            I am out of danger. If my partner is under the influence of
            drugs or alcohol, and I am worried that he or she may hurt
            me sexually or physically, I will try to leave the
            situation until my partner calms down.

            There are things I can do to keep safe if I am preparing to
            leave my partner. To be able to leave quickly, I will leave
            an extra set of keys, money, and other emergency items like
            clothes with someone.  Here is who I can leave these things

    <h4>More information about Safety when leaving</h4>
    <p>
        If you need counseling, legal assistance in obtaining a
        restraining order, or emergency housing Call 311 and ask for
        the NYC Domestic Violence Hotline. The numbers for the hotline
        will be printed for you in your plan. If you are feeling
        threatened by your partner or in more immediate danger, call
        911 for the police.
    </p>
    <p>
        Keep a calling card on you at all times. If you use your cell
        phone, the following month the telephone bill will tell your
        partner those numbers that you called after you left. To keep
        your calls confidential, you must use a calling card for a
        limited time when you first leave.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any social media accounts (e.g., Facebook,
        Google+, Twitter, Linked In, etc.) and are either "friends"
        with your partner or "friends" with anyone in your partner's
        social media network, it is important to block your partner
        and/or his/her friends so they cannot access you via these
        avenues.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to review your safety plan occasionally. How
        often will you sit down and review your safety plan?
    </p>
    <p>
        Rehearse your escape plan and, as appropriate, practice it
        with your children.
    </p>
    <p>
        See if your phone company can block your abuser's phone number
        from calling your phone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Change your usernames, email addresses, passwords, and/or cell
        phone number.
    </p>
    <p>
        Save and keep track of any abusive, threatening or harassing
        comments, posts, or texts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now that you have a copy of this plan, do you have a safe
        place to keep it at home or with a friend? Plan where to keep
        this list. Try to find a safe place to keep the 24-hour
        hotline number and other important numbers.
