Creating Facilitators
=====================

To create a facilitator, log in as a superuser, then create a normal user from
the Django admin section. All users that are created in the eworth system like
this are considered "facilitators". Optionally, you can give this user "staff
status", which allows them to see the "Assess" section of the dashboard,
letting them retrieve the reports.

Participant users are created separately, within the application.
